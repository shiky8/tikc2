# tikc2
TikC2 is a proof-of-concept Command &amp; Control (C2) framework that leverages TikTok as a covert communication channel. Operators issue Linux commands via comments on TikTok videos, and the controlled system responds by generating Linux tutorial videos that embed command outputs. This approach avoids traditional network callbacks.
